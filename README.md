# CoderHouse Staff & Alumni analysis
So... this was originally part of a **workshop**, CoderHouse gave us a sample of their own database and asked us to analyze the data with a couple of prompts. More than limiting myself to what they asked for, I saw this as an opportuny to explore **PowerBI** as a tool and refine my **Storytelling** skills (I was pretty excited about it after reading *Storytelling With Data* from Cole Nussbaumer).

I've created far more Metrics and KPI's than what they asked for, and I even ended up crossing data from outer sources with the original database to make a pretty good looking **map**! 

I hope this give you an idea of what kind of visualizations you could expect from me :)

Warning! - The visuals are in Spanish

## General Structure
Brand colors and icons were used to represent a for-and-from CoderHouse report. A simple but effective distribution of four light colored visual graphs on the center-right alongside selection indicators on the left and dark filters on the same column was used for an aesthetically pleasing report with no visual clutter (seriously, it was too much bright until I came up with the idea of the dark filters). Navigation icons were selected according to the aesthetic and thematic of the project.
